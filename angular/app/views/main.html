                <h2>What is the NHC?</h2>
                <p>The Nutrition Habit Challenge (NHC) is a community-wide wellness initiative designed to educate, motivate and inspire community members to take personal responsibility for improving their health habits. Using the "less is more" philosophy, the NHC encourages participants to make a manageable nutrition commitment for the month of February.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Participants create a secure login for the NHC site and then register for the challenge by selecting their healthy habit and tracking their progress during the month of February. This is all done through the interactive NHC website registration process and dashboard tracking interface.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our hope is that you decide to not only participate, but become an advocate for the Challenge by encouraging your family and friends to do the same. Our philosophy is to make a difference where you can make a difference; start with yourself, then your family, then your community.</p>
