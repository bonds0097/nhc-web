        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>Most of us understand the value of good nutrition. Unfortunately, many of us struggle with putting that knowledge
            into practice on a daily basis. If this sounds too familiar, join us for the <strong>Nutrition Habit Challenge 2017.</strong></p>
        <p>The Challenge is four weeks long, beginning <strong>Wednesday, 2/1/17</strong> and ending <strong>Tuesday, 2/28/17</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Hereâ€™s how it works:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Choose a nutritional behavior you would like to change</strong>
                    <br> The behavior must be significant enough to positively impact your health, but manageable enough
                    that you can be successful for 25 of the 29 days.
                    <br> Some ideas include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>No snacking on anything but fruit after dinner</em></li>
                    <li><em>Drink water instead of soda or juice</em></li>
                    <li><em>Prepare healthy snacks for work each day</em></li>
                </ul>
